# AI-cartracking
This code base is a modified version of the Driverless Car written by Chris Piech at Stanford University. (https://stanford-cs221.github.io/winter2021/assignments/car/index.html)
What I implemented in this project is the observe, elapseTime and particle filter function by using Bayesian Networks.
